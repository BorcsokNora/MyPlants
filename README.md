Watering plants reminder app - a Flutter playground project

## Features

When clicking on the button, the application saves the last watering time in the shared preferences, 
and shows the last saved watering time on the UI.
Also, the plant image changes when watering is due.

## Run the project

- You can either run the project in Android Studio
- Or run in your browser with [Zapp](https://zapp.run) by copy-pasting the content of the MyApp.dart file
